Ooops, I clearly don't understand exactly what I am doing because this is my first blog post.
This is my first blog post. I created this site with the help of @github-learning-lab bot.
The different languages I used are Markdown and jekyll.
I used the techniques I learned yesterday. Those techniques are how to make changes
and code in github.
